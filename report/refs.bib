 abstract = {We consider the problem of providing incentives over time for an agent with constant absolute risk aversion. The optimal compensation scheme is found to be a linear function of a vector of N accounts which count the number of times that each of the N kinds of observable events occurs. The number N is independent of the number of time periods, so the accounts may entail substantial aggregation. In a continuous time version of the problem, the agent controls the drift rate of a vector of accounts that is subject to frequent, small random fluctuations. The solution is as if the problem were the static one in which the agent controls only the mean of a multivariate normal distribution and the principal is constrained to use a linear compensation rule. If the principal can observe only coarser linear aggregates, such as revenues, costs, or profits, the optimal compensation scheme is then a linear function of those aggregates. The combination of exponential utility, normal distributions, and linear compensation schemes makes computations and comparative statics easy to do, as we illustrate. We interpret our linearity results as deriving in part from the richness of the agent's strategy space, which makes it possible for the agent to undermine and exploit complicated, nonlinear functions of the accounting aggregates.},

 abstract = {We analyze repeated moral hazard with discounting in a competitive credit market with risk neutrality. Even without learning or risk aversion, long-term bank-borrower relationships are welfare enhancing. The main result is that the borrower obtains an infinite sequence of unsecured loans at below spot market cost following the first good project realization. This contract produces first-best action choices. Prior to this stage, the borrower gets secured loans with above-market borrowing cost. The optimal contract thus displays a "selective memory" feature, taking only one of two forms at any given point in time, depending on prior history.},

This chapter discusses moral hazard. The principal–agent relationship embodies a special form of moral hazard, which can be called “one-sided,” but moral hazard can also be “many-sided.” The paradigmatic model of many-sided moral hazard is the partnership in which there are many agents but no principal. The output of the partnership depends jointly on the actions of the partners and on the stochastic environment; each partner observes only the output (and his or her own action) but not the actions of the other partners or the environment. This engenders a free-rider problem. As in the case of principal–agent relationships, a partnership, too, may last many periods. The chapter presents the principal–agent model formally and describes some salient features of optimal principal–agent contracts when the relationship lasts a single period. In a large class of cases, equilibrium in the one-period game is Pareto-inefficient. This is a well-known problem in providing risk-averse agent insurance while simultaneously giving the agent the incentives to take, from the principal's perspective, appropriate actions. The chapter also discusses other properties of static contracts such as monotonicity of the agent's compensation in observed profits.}

 abstract = {This paper considers a repeated principal agent relationship where the principal is risk neutral, the agent is risk averse, the principal can borrow or save at a fixed interest rate, and the agent discounts future consumption. It is shown that memory plays a very strong role in every Pareto-optimal contract. Sufficient conditions for Pareto-optimal contracts to exhibit rising or falling wages are identified. Finally, it is shown that the restriction of the agent's access to credit is necessary to achieve a Pareto-optimal outcome. In particular, under every Pareto-optimal contract for every outcome of every period the agent would choose to save some of his wage if he could.},
